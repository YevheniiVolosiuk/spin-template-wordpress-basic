The **Spin WordPress Template** provides a modern, efficient boilerplate for building WordPress sites quickly. Built with speed and simplicity in mind, this template includes pre-configured settings and developer tools.

---

## Features

- **Docker**: Containerized environment setup with Docker for easy deployment, consistent development, and simplified dependency management across all platforms.
- **MariaDB**: Fast and reliable open-source database solution, optimized for scalability and compatibility with MySQL for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Traefik**: Integrated reverse proxy and load balancer with automated SSL management, simplifying traffic routing and enhancing security.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or remove components based on project needs, allowing for flexible configurations tailored to different project requirements.
- **Optimized for Speed**: Minimal dependencies and efficient code structure to ensure fast loading times, enhancing user experience and performance.

## Installation

To get started, you need [Spin](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed.

Next, run:

```
spin new YevheniiVolosiuk/spin-template-wordpress-basic --branch main
```

## Configuration

### Changing the Domain Name

If you want to change the domain name for your development environment:

1. Open `docker-compose.dev.yml` and navigate to line 37. Change the value for `HOST` to your desired domain name.
2. Add the same domain name to your system's `hosts` file.

### Adding the WordPress Configuration File

1. Go to the `public` directory and make a copy of the `config-simple.php` file.
2. Add the following constants to the copied `config.php` file and fill in the database values as specified in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file under the MariaDB service.

   Ensure you use the `mariadb` service name for the `DB_HOST` value.

   ```php
   $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
   define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');

   define('WP_HOME', 'https://change-to-your-domain-name-url-here');
   define('WP_SITEURL', 'https://change-to-your-domain-name-url-here');
   ```

### Installing and Trusting the SSU CA

To enable secure HTTPS connections in your local development environment, you need to install and trust the Server Side Up Certificate Authority (SSU CA):

1. Visit [Server Side Up CA](https://serversideup.net/ca/) and download the SSU CA certificate.
2. Follow the instructions provided to install and trust the certificate on your operating system and browser.
    - **For System Trust**: Install the certificate in your system's trusted certificate store.
    - **For Browser Trust**: Import the certificate into your browser's certificate manager.
3. Once the certificate is installed and trusted, your browser will recognize the local HTTPS connections as secure.

```

This will start the Docker containers and set up your development environment.
